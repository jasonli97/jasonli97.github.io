            <h1>Final Project</h1>
                <p1 id="final_project">For the final project me and my partner created a snake game.  
                    Where the user is moving a snake and there goal is to collect as many red circles (which are considered food for the snake)
                    as possible in order to grow longer and attain a high score. However, they must try to avoid to hit the edge of the game board 
                    or else the snake would die and the player would loose and have to start all over again.
                    Players also have the ability to choose their snake color and the speed level in the selection screen.</p>
                    <p2 id="final_project"> To play users would hit the start button and then select the speed they like their snake to move at. 
                    Normal is a speed of 1. 1:1 speed is when the snake would move faster each time after they would eat the food. Fast would set the speed at 3.
                    Then the player would would hit the play button and use their arrow keys to navigate the snake around the screen while trying not to hit the
                    border of the playing area. </p2>
