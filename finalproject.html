            <h1>Final Project</h1>
                <p1 id="final_project">For the final project me and my partner created a snake game.  
                    Where the user is moving a snake and there goal is to collect as many red circles (which are considered food for the snake)
                    as possible in order to grow longer and attain a high score. However, they must try to avoid to hit the edge of the game board 
                    or else the snake would die and the player would loose and have to start all over again.
                    Players also have the ability to choose their snake color and the speed level in the selection screen.</p>
