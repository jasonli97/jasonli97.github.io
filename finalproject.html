            <h1>Final Project</h1>
                <p1>For the final project me and my partner created a snake game.  Where the user is snake and there goal is to collect as many red circles on the screen which is considered food for the snake.  For every piece of food that is collected by the user the snake will move faster and their score would increase as well.  However, they must try to avoid to hit the edge of the game board or else the snake would die and the play would loose and have to start all over again.</p>
