            <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p width="50%">My name is Jason Li.  I am currenlty a Freshman at the University of Rhode Island majoring in Computer Science.  I programmed this website in my CSC 106 class.  
                    I have always had an interest with technology as a kid growing up so choosing Computer Science as my major was not a difficult descion.  In my free time I usually watch tech videos or read article about tech.  
                    One tech newssite that I read is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/">The Verge</a>.  Lastly, a fun fact about me is that I was in a hydroponics club in high school and it was also featured on a local mews story.</p>
